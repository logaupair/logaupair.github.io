It has been two days now since I arrived in a small town in Westchester County to spend my aupair year abroad. My flight via Zurich to JFK Airport was less exhausting than expected but I had to get along these days with jetlag - means waking up around 4:30 and already getting tired in the early evening from that moment on it turned dark.
But my host family is doing its best to make everything comfortable for me - which is great!

On Saturday the other aupair took me to 'the movies' and I was really impressed how large the bags for popcorn and the drinks can be - even when you order a small. There was no chance to finish it.

This morning I got the chance to take a little walk through the neighbourhood. Because all the land is privatised there are everywhere large trees which make you feel like living in a forest. It was truly beautiful because all the leaves turned golden and red. Also, some cute squirrels were running through the gardens but unfortunately I had no chance to take a picture of them. Maybe next time…
