Finally I found something that doesn't make me feel like a stranger in America: Concerts! Woohoo. In the last few weeks I had the chance to see FOALS and Sun Kil Moon. Aswell I went to a little festival in Brooklyn.

# Nov 4 // FOALS + Bear Hands + KIEV // United Palace
This was surprising from every point of view. The show was in northern Manhattan near Bronx, so everyone recommended me NOT to take the train, "it's only half an hour by car". Not thinking much about that, I took my Toyota and the not really working iPhone 4 with the "Waze" navigation app that I'm using here. Finally it took me about one hour and a half to get to the venue, because I missed a few exits and turns. Plus super expensive valet parking and a low phone battery. I felt quite exhausted. But as soon as I entered the United Palace I overcame the shock and had a great time. I didn't have many expectations and was really surprised by the venue and the show. A very talkative psychiatrist sat next to me and told me more about the venue. United Palace is a former theatre from the 20s, now actually a Baptist church but also a music venue on the weekends.

# 10 Nov // Sun Kil Moon + Jesu // Warsaw Ballroom
This time I took the train which was so much better. The show was in a small venue in Williamsburg and it was very easy to get there by metro. Williamsburg, Brooklyn is very beautiful, less busy than Manhattan and a lot of small stores, bars and restaurants. When I arrived at the Warsaw Ballroom the show already had begun. Mark Kozelek was singing an elegy about the presidential election and continued with songs from the new album and a dedication to Leonard Cohen who had just passed away on that day. The show was crowded by many young and hip people and much more familiar than the FOALS concert of the week before.

# 12 Nov // Cut Worms + Nassau + Ben Seretan // Union Pool
Only two days later I, again, set out for Brooklyn by train and went to a 10 $ Show at Union Pool. That place was a little bar with a Taco Truck in the backyard. Great music shows, great bar and I met super friendly people from Chile who showed me more of Williamsburg after the concert.
