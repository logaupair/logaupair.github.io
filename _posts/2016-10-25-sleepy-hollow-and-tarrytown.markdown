Yesterday we went to Sleepy Hollow, a village in the eastern part of Westchester County, just next to Hudson River. We took a walk around the famous Sleepy Hollow Cemetary where Washington Irving is buried and visited the light house in Tarrytown. 
I took a lot of pictures with my camera but I need to get the right connecting cable or card reader to put them on my computer. So that's why you only see the pictures from my phone yet. The last one shows Mamaroneck Habor Island - it's not far from the place where I live.
I am still off today and will visit Manhattan in the afternoon. I am very excited and will keep you on track!
